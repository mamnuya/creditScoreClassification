# Credit Score Classification

This project explores the
classification results of Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost
Classifiers. Additionally, we consider the classification with combinations of applying Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), not applying SMOTE, applying outlier removal, and not applying outlier removal. We determine the best models for classifications, while including visualizations and performance results. This project includes a written report evaluating results, methods, motivations, previous studies, and more.
